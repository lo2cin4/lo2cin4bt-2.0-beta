All fields are local research diagnostics. They are not investment advice.

## Core Performance Metrics

| Field | Unit | Meaning | Misread warning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| `std` | ratio | Return volatility for the source period. | Check sampling frequency. |
| `annualized_std` | ratio/year | Annualized volatility. | Depends on annualization assumption. |
| `downside_risk` | ratio | Downside deviation. | Only downside samples count. |

## Trade And Exposure Metrics

| Field | Unit | Meaning | Misread warning |
